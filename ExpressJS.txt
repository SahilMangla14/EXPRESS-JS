How we exchange data on the web

1) we open the computer
2) We go to our favourite search engine
3) Then we provide the url or basically we request a web page
4) These requests are in the form of http and that is why, these are called http messages
5) Then these requests are send to the web server or in simple words node
6) Then the node or the web server provides the response
7) Suppose our computer works only from 8 in morning to 6 in evening
8) What if I request a web page at 7 in evening
9) To solve this problem, we have cloud which is basically a bunch of computers or web servers that make the thing available all the time
10) We will be using node and more specifically express.js which is a framework of nodejs and it makes life easy
